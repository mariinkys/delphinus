 This project contains a small web application written in Rust with the <a href="https://leptos.dev/" target="_blank">Leptos</a> framework, it can generate flashcards compatible with Quizlet and Studysmarter(Vaia) for both Chinese and Japanese.

## Warning

The flashcards generated by this software may contain errors, revision of the flashcards is advised. As with any software, use it with care and at your own risk.

## How to Use?

[See the FAQ](https://delphinus.mariinkys.dev/faq)

## Development Notes

In order to have the 'copy to clipboard' button working you need to compile with the `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis`.

Ex: `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis cargo leptos watch` or `RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis cargo leptos build --release`.

Also remember the env variables needed for the server binary:
```
export LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME="leptos_start"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT="site" #necessary
export LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR="pkg"
export LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR="127.0.0.1:3000"
export LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT="3001"
```
