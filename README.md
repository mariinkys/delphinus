# Delphinus Flashcards

This project contains a small web application written in Go that can generate flashcards compatible with Quizlet and Studysmarter(Vaia) for both Chinese and Japanese.

## Warning

This project, which has been done as a "for fun" project, is neither the most optimized nor the most accurate software in existence. As with any software, use it with care and at your own risk.

I may update or may not update this application, and I may fix or may not fix any bugs in this application.
I have many ideas that I want to try on this project, you can find more information on the FAQ Page of the project.

## How to Use?

<b>This application is not live for now</b>, if you want to use the project, you can download it and, with Go installed, run the `.run.sh` found in the root of the project. You will, again, find more information on the FAQ Page of the project.

The application is expected to be live in the near future.
