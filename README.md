# Delphinus Flashcards

This project contains a small web application written in Go and Vue that can generate flashcards compatible with Quizlet and Studysmarter(Vaia) for both Chinese and Japanese.

## Warning

This project, which has been done as a "for fun" project, is neither the most optimized nor the most accurate software in existence. As with any software, use it with care and at your own risk.

I may update or may not update this application, and I may fix or may not fix any bugs in this application.
I have many ideas that I want to try on this project, you can find more information on the FAQ Page of the project.

## Thanks

This software is possible thanks to many awesome projects, such as the [JMDict Project (Japanese Dictionary)](https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html) and the [CC-CEDICT (Chinese Dictionary)](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict).
